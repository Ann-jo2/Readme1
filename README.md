# Hilarious Vehicle Sales Insights ðŸš—

Welcome to the Department of Silly Statistics! This project is a whimsical exploration of fictional vehicle sales data, complete with humor and data visualizations.

## Project Description
This tool simulates random events and provides insights into a parallel universe of vehicle sales. Please note that all data is entirely fictional, and any resemblance to real vehicles or sales figures is purely coincidental.

## Instructions for Running Locally
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Streamlit app with `streamlit run app.py`.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to explore the app locally.

## Project Notebook
The `notebooks/EDA.ipynb` notebook contains exploratory data analysis. Ensure the notebook is functional, showing outputs based on the real dataset. Pay attention to preprocessing steps for accurate analysis.

## Web App
Explore the Streamlit web app at [https://<APP_NAME>.onrender.com/](https://<APP_NAME>.onrender.com/). Enjoy the humor-infused visualizations!

### Additional Update
### Diversifying Data Visualization
In the web app, add a new chart that offers a different perspective on the data. This could focus on attributes other than vehicle type, providing additional insights.
